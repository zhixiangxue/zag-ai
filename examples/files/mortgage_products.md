## Current Mortgage Rates

## Fixed-Rate Mortgages

Fixed-rate mortgages provide stability and predictability, with interest rates that remain constant throughout the life of the loan. This option is ideal for borrowers who prefer consistent monthly payments and protection against rising interest rates.

| Product Type        | Term     | Interest Rate   | APR    | Minimum Down Payment   |   Points | Loan Limit   |
|---------------------|----------|-----------------|--------|------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Fixed-Rate Mortgage | 30- Year | 6.125%          | 6.275% | 3%                     |    0.5   | $726,200     |
| Fixed-Rate Mortgage | 15- Year | 5.750%          | 5.920% | 5%                     |    0.625 | $1,089,300   |

## Key Benefits:

- Payment Stability : Your principal and interest payments remain unchanged for the entire loan term
- Budgeting Ease : No surprises with monthly payments, making financial planning straightforward
- Rate Protection : Lock in today's rates, regardless of future market fluctuations
- Early Payoff Options : No prepayment penalties on most fixed-rate loans

## Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs)

Adjustable-rate mortgages offer lower initial interest rates compared to fixed-rate options, making them attractive for borrowers who plan to sell or refinance before the initial fixed period ends.

| Product Type   | Term     | Interest Rate   | APR    | Minimum Down Payment   |   Points | Loan Limit   |
|----------------|----------|-----------------|--------|------------------------|----------|--------------|
| 5/1 ARM        | 30- Year | 5.875%          | 6.125% | 5%                     |    0.5   | $726,200     |
| 7/1 ARM        | 30- Year | 6.000%          | 6.250% | 5%                     |    0.5   | $1,089,300   |
| 10/1 ARM       | 30- Year | 6.125%          | 6.375% | 10%                    |    0.625 | $1,500,000   |

## Important Considerations:

- Initial Fixed Period : The number of years your rate remains fixed before adjustments begin
- Adjustment Caps : Limits on how much your rate can change at each adjustment period
- Index and Margin : Your rate adjusts based on a market index plus a fixed margin
- Payment Shock : Be prepared for potential payment increases after the initial period

## Government-Backed Loans

|----------------|----------|-----------------|--------|------------------------|----------|--------------|

|----------------|----------|-----------------|--------|------------------------|----------|--------------|

## Eligibility Requirements

## Credit Score Guidelines

Your credit score is one of the most important factors in determining your mortgage eligibility and interest rate. Here's how different loan programs typically view credit scores:

| Loan Program   | Minimum Credit Score   | Preferred Score Range    |
|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Conventional   | 620                    | 740+ for best rates      |
| FHA            | 580 (3.5% down)        | 620+ for better terms    |
| VA             | 620                    | 660+ for optimal pricing |
| Jumbo          | 700                    | 740+ for best rates      |

## Improving Your Credit Score:

- Pay all bills on time
- Keep credit card balances low
- Avoid opening new credit accounts before applying
- Check your credit report for errors
- Maintain a mix of credit types

## Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

Your DTI ratio compares your monthly debt payments to your gross monthly income. Lenders use this ratio to assess your ability to manage monthly mortgage payments.

| Loan Program   | Maximum DTI Ratio   | Front-End Ratio   |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Conventional   | 45%                 | 28%               |
| FHA            | 50%                 | 31%               |
| VA             | 41%                 | N/A               |
| Jumbo          | 43%                 | 28%               |

## Calculating Your DTI:

- Front-End Ratio : Housing expenses (PITI) ÷ Gross monthly income
- Back-End Ratio : All monthly debt payments ÷ Gross monthly income
- PITI : Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance

## Income and Employment Verification

Lenders require consistent income history to ensure you can afford your mortgage payments.

| Employment Verification | 2 Years             | 2 Years             | 2 Years             | 2 Years             |
| Self-Employment         | 2 Years tax returns | 2 Years tax returns | 2 Years tax returns | 2 Years tax returns |
| Variable Income         | 2 Year average      | 2 Year average      | 2 Year average      | 2 Year average      |

- Overtime and bonuses (with history)
- Commission income

| Asset Type          | Documentation Required             | Purpose                           |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Bank Accounts       | 2 months statements                | Down payment, closing costs       |

## ARM Product Details

## How Adjustable-Rate Mortgages Work

Adjustable-rate mortgages have an initial fixed period followed by periodic adjustments based on a market index plus a fixed margin. Understanding the adjustment structure is crucial for making an informed decision.

| Feature               | 5/1 ARM        | 7/1 ARM        | 10/1 ARM       |
|-----------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Initial Fixed Period  | 5 Years        | 7 Years        | 10 Years       |
| Adjustment Frequency  | Annual         | Annual         | Annual         |
| Initial Cap           | 2%             | 2%             | 2%             |
| Periodic Cap          | 2%             | 2%             | 2%             |
| Lifetime Cap          | 5%             | 5%             | 5%             |
| Index                 | 1-Year CMT     | 1-Year CMT     | 1-Year CMT     |
| Margin                | 2.25%          | 2.25%          | 2.25%          |
| Negative Amortization | Not Allowed    | Not Allowed    | Not Allowed    |
| Conversion Option     | Yes ($500 fee) | Yes ($500 fee) | Yes ($500 fee) |

## Understanding Caps

Initial Cap : The maximum your rate can increase at the first adjustment after the fixed period. For example, if your initial rate is 5.875%, it cannot exceed 7.875% at the first adjustment.

Periodic Cap : The maximum your rate can increase at each subsequent adjustment period. If your rate increases by 2% at the first adjustment, it could potentially increase by another 2% at the next adjustment.

Lifetime Cap : The maximum your rate can increase over the life of the loan. This provides protection against extreme rate increases.

## Index and Margin

Your ARM rate is calculated as Index + Margin . The index is a published financial index that reflects general market interest rates. The margin is a fixed percentage added to the index that represents the lender's profit.

## Common Indexes:

- 1-Year CMT : Constant Maturity Treasury
- LIBOR : London Interbank Offered Rate (phasing out)
- SOFR : Secured Overnight Financing Rate (replacing LIBOR)

## When to Consider an ARM

ARMs can be beneficial in certain situations:

- Short-Term Ownership : If you plan to sell or refinance within the initial fixed period
- Lower Initial Payments : Lower initial rates can help you qualify for a larger loan
- Expected Income Growth : If you expect your income to increase significantly
- Declining Rate Environment : If you believe interest rates will decrease

## Risks to Consider:

- Payment Shock : Monthly payments could increase significantly after the fixed period
- Refinancing Risk : You may not be able to refinance if your financial situation changes
- Market Volatility : Interest rates could rise faster than expected

|-------------------|--------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|

| 30 Days           | Free   | +0.125%                     | Yes (+0.25%)          |
| 45 Days           | 0.25%  | +0.25%                      | Yes (+0.375%)         |
| 60 Days           | 0.375% | +0.375%                     | Yes (+0.5%)           |
| 90 Days           | 0.5%   | +0.5%                       | Limited availability  |
| Float Down Option | 0.625% | Available for 60+ day locks | One-time exercise     |

## When to Lock Your Rate

## Consider locking when:

- You've found a property and have an executed purchase agreement
- You're comfortable with current market rates
- Your closing date is within the lock period
- Market volatility is high

## Consider floating when:

- You're still shopping for a home
- Market rates are trending downward
- Your closing date is uncertain
- You're willing to accept rate risk for potential savings

## Float Down Option

The float down option allows you to lock your rate while retaining the ability to lower it if market rates improve before closing.

## How it works:

- Pay an additional fee (typically 0.625% of loan amount)
- If market rates drop by at least 0.25% before closing, you can exercise the option
- Your rate will be adjusted to the lower market rate
- Can only be exercised once during the lock period

## When to consider:

- You want rate protection but believe rates may decline
- Market volatility is high
- Your closing date is several weeks away
- You're willing to pay for the flexibility

## Documentation Requirements
